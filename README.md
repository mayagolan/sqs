# Stacks, Queues, and Sets

Linked Lists have many applications. Most modern programming languages provide Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) to use linked data structures. These APIs are most often generic,
and allow to use the same Abstract Data Types (ADT) to contain many types: int, string,
float, or any other type (built-in or user-defined) etc. . .
This is composed of three parts, and aims at writing a small library (or API) of simple
linked data structures: stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables.
These will focus only on data structures containing either intergers (type int), or characters (type
char), or strings of characters (type std::string).
